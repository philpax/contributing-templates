# contributing-templates

Inspiration for `CONTRIBUTING.md` files for my own projects, which should serve as guidelines for humans and agents alike.

The intended use is to initialise the `CONTRIBUTING.md` for a given project using a combination of `general.md` and a language-specific file.

As per [Coding Agents Are Easy, Actually](https://karashiiro.leaflet.pub/3mbfapvdvss2b), this explicitly targets `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and not `AGENTS.md`; humans need the same kind of documentation!

At the time of writing, these files are a cut-down and edited version of [cargo-nextest's `AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/nextest-rs/nextest/blob/main/AGENTS.md), which was primarily authored by [@sunshowers](https://github.com/sunshowers). 
I really admire the thoughtful work they've done in putting together `nextest`'s `AGENTS.md`, and I'm equally thankful that it's something that the community as a whole can benefit from! Accordingly, this repository is also licensed MIT and Apache2.
