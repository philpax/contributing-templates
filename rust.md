## Code style

### Rust edition and linting

- Use Rust 2024 edition.
- Lint and format with `cargo clippy --all-features --all-targets` and `cargo fmt`. Ensure this is run at the end of each complete task. (You do not need to do this for intermediate steps.)

### Type system patterns

- **Builder patterns** for complex construction (e.g., `TestRunnerBuilder`)
- **Type states** encoded in generics when state transitions matter
- **Lifetimes** used extensively to avoid cloning (e.g., `TestInstance<'a>`)
- **Restricted visibility**: Use `pub(crate)` and `pub(super)` liberally

### Error handling

- Do not use `thiserror`. Instead, manually implement `std::fmt::Error` for a given error `struct` or `enum`.
- Group errors by category with an `ErrorKind` enum when appropriate.
- Provide rich error context using structured error types.
- Two-tier error model:
  - `ExpectedError`: User/external errors with semantic exit codes.
  - Internal errors: Programming errors that may panic or use internal error types.
- Error display messages should be lowercase sentence fragments suitable for "failed to {error}".

### Async patterns

- Do not introduce async to a project without async.
- Use `tokio` for async runtime (multi-threaded).
- Use async for I/O and concurrency, keep other code synchronous.

### Module organization

- Use `mod.rs` files to re-export public items.
- Keep module boundaries strict with restricted visibility.
- Use `#[cfg(unix)]` and `#[cfg(windows)]` for conditional compilation.
- **Always** import types or functions at the very top of the module, with the one exception being `cfg()`-gated functions. Never import types or modules within function contexts, other than this `cfg()`-gated exception.
- It is okay to import enum variants for pattern matching, though.

### Memory and performance

- Use `Arc` or borrows for shared immutable data.
- Use `smol_str` for efficient small string storage.
- Careful attention to cloning referencing. Avoid cloning if code has a natural tree structure.
- Stream data (e.g. iterators) where possible rather than buffering.

## Testing 

### Testing tools

- **test-case**: For parameterized tests.
- **proptest**: For property-based testing.
- **insta**: For snapshot testing.
- **libtest-mimic**: For custom test harnesses.
- **pretty_assertions**: For better assertion output.
