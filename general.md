## General conventions

### Correctness over convenience

- Model the full error space—no shortcuts or simplified error handling.
- Handle all edge cases, including race conditions, signal timing, and platform differences.
- Use the type system to encode correctness constraints.
- Prefer compile-time guarantees over runtime checks where possible.

### User experience as a primary driver

- Provide structured, helpful error messages that can be rendered with an appropriate library at a later stage.
- Make progress reporting responsive and informative.
- Maintain consistency across platforms even when underlying OS capabilities differ. Use OS-native logic rather than trying to emulate Unix on Windows (or vice versa).
- Write user-facing messages in clear, present tense: "Frobnicator now supports..." not "Frobnicator now supported..."

### Pragmatic incrementalism

- "Not overly generic"—prefer specific, composable logic over abstract frameworks.
- Evolve the design incrementally rather than attempting perfect upfront architecture.

### Production-grade engineering

- Use type system extensively: newtypes, builder patterns, type states, lifetimes.
- Use message passing or the actor model to avoid data races in concurrent code.
- Test comprehensively, including edge cases, race conditions, and stress tests.
- Pay attention to what facilities already exist for testing, and aim to reuse them.
- Getting the details right is really important!

### Documentation

- Use inline comments to explain "why," not just "what".
- Don't add narrative comments in function bodies. Only add a comment if what you're doing is non-obvious or special in some way, or if something needs a deeper "why" explanation.
- Module-level documentation should explain purpose and responsibilities.
- **Always** use periods at the end of code comments.
- **Never** use title case in headings and titles. Always use sentence case.
- Always use the Oxford comma.
- Don't omit articles ("a", "an", "the"). Write "the file has a newer version" not "file has newer version".
